Open the Google Cloud Shell by clicking on the icon on the top right of the screen: Once opened, you can use it to run the instructions for this lab. 1.1 Overview of the Sample Application \u00b6 This package contains two application components which will be used throughout the course to demonstrate features of Kubernetes: gowebapp This directory contains a simple Go-based note-taking web application. It includes a home page, registration page, login page, about page, and note management page. Configuration for this application is stored in code/config/config.json. This file is used to configure the backing data store for the application, which in this course is MySQL. Later in the course, we will externalize this configuration in order to take advantage of Kubernetes Secrets and ConfigMaps. This will include some minor modifications to the Go source code. Go programming experience is not required to complete the exercises. For more details about the internal design and implementation of the Go web application, see code/README.md. gowebapp-mysql This directory contains the schema file used to setup the backing MySQL database for the Go web application. 1.1 Build Dockers image for frontend application \u00b6 Step 1 Locate and review the go source code: cd ~ git clone https://github.com/Cloud-Architects-Program/ycit019 cd ~/ycit019/Assignment1/ Result Two folders with go app and mysql config has been reviewed. Step 2 Setup vim editor with appropriate color schema Note Skip this step if you use another editor. echo \"colo elflord\" > ~/.vimrc Step 3 Write Dockerfile for your frontend application cd ~/ycit019/Assignment1/gowebapp Create a file named Dockerfile in this directory for the frontend Go app. Use vi or any preferred text editor. vim Dockerfile The template below provides a starting point for defining the contents of this file.

Run and test Docker images locally 1.3 Test application by running with Docker Engine. \u00b6 Before putting our app in production let's run the Docker images locally, to ensure that the frontend and backend containers run and integrate properly. Step 1 Create Docker user-defined network To facilitate cross-container communication, let's first define a user-defined network named gowebapp with subnet range 172.19.0.0/16 in which to run the frontend and backend containers: #TODO docker xxx Step 2 Launch backend container Next, let's launch a frontend and backend container using the Docker CLI. First, we launch the database container, as it will take a bit longer to startup, and the frontend container depends on it. Notice how we are injecting the database password into the MySQL configuration as an environment variable: #TODO Launch `backend` container in background #TODO Use this settings: `--name gowebapp-mysql` `--hostname gowebapp-mysql` #TODO Container needs to run on network: `gowebapp` #TODO Include following Env Variable in the command: `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=rootpasswd` Step 3 Launch frontend container Now launch a frontend container, mapping the container port 80 - where the web application is exposed - to port 8080 on the host machine: docker run -p 8080:80 --net gowebapp -d --name gowebapp \\ --hostname gowebapp <user-name>/gowebapp:v1 #TODO Launch `frontend` container in background #TODO Use this settings: `--name gowebapp` `--hostname gowebapp` #TODO Map the container port 80 - to port 8080 on the host machine #TODO Container needs to run on network: `gowebapp` Step 4 Test the application locally Now that we've launched the application containers, let's try to test the web application locally. You should be able to access the application at Google Cloud Web Preview Console: Note Web Preview using port 8080 by default. If you application using other port, you can edit this as needed. Once you can see the application loaded. Create an account and login. Write something on your Notepad and save it. This will verify that the application is working and properly integrates with the backend database container. Task Take a screenshot of running application. Step 5 Inspect the MySQL database Let's connect to the backend MySQL database container and run some queries to ensure that application persistence is working properly: #TODO docker xxx Step 6 Once inside the container, connect to MySQL database: mysql -u root -p password: Note Use password that has beed used in MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD env variable. Step 7 Once connected, run some simple SQL commands to inspect the database tables and persistence: #Simple SQL to navigate SHOW DATABASES; USE gowebapp; SHOW TABLES; SELECT * FROM <table_name>; exit; 1.5 Cleanup running applications and unused networks \u00b6 ### TODO docker xxx","title":"Assignment1"},{"location":"assignment1/#1-containerize-applications","text":"Objective: Review process of containerizing of applications Review creation of Docker Images Review build image process","title":"1 Containerize Applications"},{"location":"assignment1/#prepare-lab-environment","text":"This lab can be executed in you GCP Cloud Environment using Google Cloud Shell.
