Use the command docker ps -a to list all containers including the ones has been stopped: docker ps -a Output: CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES 6e6db2a24a8e hello-world \"/hello\" 15 minutes ago Exited (0) 15 min dreamy_nobel Review the collumns CONTAINER ID , STATUS , COMMAND , PORTS , NAMES . In the previous section we started one container and the command docker ps -a shows it as Exited . Note You can name your own containers with --name when you use docker run. If you do not provide a name, Docker will generate a random one like the one you have. Question Why Docker names are random? How docker containers named? Step 3 Let\u2019s run the command docker images to show all the images on your local system: docker images As you see, there is only one image that was downloaded from the Docker Hub. 1.2 Specify a container main process \u00b6 Step 1 Let\u2019s run our own \"hello world\" container. For that we will use the official Ubuntu image : docker run ubuntu /bin/echo 'Hello world' Output: Unable to find image 'ubuntu:latest' locally latest: Pulling from library/ubuntu ... Status: Downloaded newer image for ubuntu:latest Hello world As you see, Docker downloaded the image ubuntu because it was not on the local machine. Step 2 Let\u2019s run the command docker images again: docker images Output: REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE ubuntu latest 42118e3df429 11 days ago 124.8 MB hello-world latest c54a2cc56cbb 4 weeks ago 1.848 kB Step 3 If you run the same \"hello world\" container again, Docker will use a local copy of the image: docker run ubuntu /bin/echo 'Hello world' Output: Hello world Question Compare Ubuntu Docker image with ISO image or with Cloud VM image. Why the size is so different ? Summary Pulling docker images from Docker Hub takes sometime. This time depends on: How large is the image? How fast is the network to Internet ? However, it is still much faster than booting traditional OS with Ubuntu on VM. If image already pulled on local host it takes fraction of a second to start a container. Running application in docker containers considered as a best practice for running CI/CD pipelines as it considerably faster than using VMs and reduce time for deploying a test environments. 1.3 Specify an image version \u00b6 Step 1 As you see, Docker has downloaded the ubuntu:latest image. You can see Ubuntu version by running the following command: docker run ubuntu /bin/cat /etc/issue.net Output: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Let\u2019s say you need a previous Ubuntu LTS release. In this case, you can specify the version you need: docker run ubuntu:14.04 /bin/cat /etc/issue.net Output: Unable to find image 'ubuntu:14.04' locally 14.04: Pulling from library/ubuntu ... Status: Downloaded newer image for ubuntu:14.04 Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS Step 2 The docker images command should show that we have 3 Ubuntu images downloaded locally: docker images Output: REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE ubuntu latest 42118e3df429 11 days ago 124.8 MB ubuntu 14.04 0ccb13bf1954 11 days ago 188 MB hello-world latest c54a2cc56cbb 4 weeks ago 1.848 kB Tip Running CI/CD pipeline with Docker using latest tag considered as a Bad Practice. Instead consider using: Versioning SHA tagging. 1.4 Run an interactive container \u00b6 Step 1 Let\u2019s use the ubuntu image to run an interactive bash session and inspect what is running inside our docker image. To achive that we going to use -i and -t flags. The -i is shorthand for --interactive , which instructs Docker to keep stdin open so that we can send commands to the sprocess. The -t flag is short for --tty and allocates a pseudo-TTY or terminal inside of the session. docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash root@17d8bdeda98e:/# Result We get a bash shell prompt inside of the container. Note Bash prompt is not availabe for all docker images. Step 2 Let's print the system information of the latest Ubuntu image: root@17d8bdeda98e:/# uname -a Linux 17d8bdeda98e 3.19.0-31-generic ... Step 3 Let's verify what Ubuntu version is run by latest image of ubuntu: root@17d8bdeda98e:/# lsb_release -a bash: lsb_release: command not found Failure Why the standard Ubuntu command that checks version of OS is not working as expeced ? Step 4 Let's verify Ubuntu version using alternative way by checking /etc/lsb-release file. root@8cbcbd0fe8d2:/# cat /etc/lsb-release DISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu DISTRIB_RELEASE=16.04 DISTRIB_CODENAME=xenial DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION=\"Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS\" Step 5 Let's compare the number of executable binaries availabe inside of the docker image versus Cloud VM that we running our class environment. First, run ls command on /bin and /usr/bin directories inside of the running ubuntu container as well as dpkg --list command that shows total number of installed packages: root@8cbcbd0fe8d2:/# ls /bin | wc -l 86 root@8cbcbd0fe8d2:/# ls /usr/bin | wc -l 233 root@eb11cd0b4106:/# dpkg --list | wc -l 101 Step 6 Use the exit command or press Ctrl-D to exit the interactive bash session back to Cloud VM. root@eb11cd0b4106:/# exit Step 7 Now run ls command on /bin and /usr/bin directories on Cloud VM that we using as our class environment: cca-user@userx-docker-vm:~$ ls /bin | wc -l 171 cca-user@userx-docker-vm:~$ ls /usr/bin | wc -l 660 cca-user@userx-docker-vm:~$ dpkg --list | wc -l 463 Result Official Docker container has much less binaries and packages installed vs Ubuntu Cloud Image. Summary Some of the use cases running docker containers in interactive mode are: Troubleshooting containerized applications Deploying and running containerized application on the existing production systems without affecting it. We've also learned that an official Docker \"minimal\" ubuntu image, does not include lsb_release command, as well as many other commands and packages that can be found in Official Ubuntu ISO image . The docker images are ment to contain only required core system commands and functions to make Images as light as possible. That say you can still install required packages using apt-get install , however this may increase size of docker image considerably. Hint While Docker Ubuntu image we used so far or Docker Centos image are very familiar to users and can be good starting point for learning docker containers. Using them in production or development considered as a Bad Practice. This is due those images still considered as heavy and potentially contain a lot more valnurabilities compare to specialized images. To reduce image pull time from docker hub and follow the best secuirity practices consider using specialized images that works well with you underlining code (Node image for NodeJS applications and etc.). Examples of specialized images are: Alpine Linux Node Atomic In fact, not so long ago all the official Docker Images in Docker-Hub has been moved to use Alpine Image . Step 8 Finally let\u2019s check that when the shell process has finished, the container stops: docker ps 1.5 Run a container in a background \u00b6 Now we know how to connect to running container and execute commands in it. However in most cases you just want run a container in a background so it can do a specific action. Step 1 Run a container in a background using the -d command line argument: docker run -d ubuntu /bin/sh -c \"while true; do date; echo hello world; sleep 1; done\" Result Command should return the container ID. Step 2 Let\u2019s use the docker ps command to see running containers: docker ps CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES ac231579e57f ubuntu \"/bin/sh -c 'while tr\" 1 minute ago Up 11 minute evil_golick Note Container id is going to be different in your case Hint Instead of using full container-id when building commands, it is possible simply type first few characters of container-id, to make things nice and easy. Step 3 Let\u2019s use container-id to show the container standard output: docker logs <container-id> Thu Jan 26 00:23:45 UTC 2017 hello world Thu Jan 26 00:23:46 UTC 2017 hello world Thu Jan 26 00:23:47 UTC 2017 hello world ... As you can see, in the docker ps command output, the auto generated container name is evil_golick (your container can have a different name). Step 4 Now, instead of using docker contaier-id use container name to show the container standard output: docker logs <name> Thu Jan 26 00:23:51 UTC 2017 hello world Thu Jan 26 00:23:52 UTC 2017 hello world Thu Jan 26 00:23:53 UTC 2017 hello world ... Step 5 Finally, let\u2019s stop our container: docker stop <name> Step 6 Check, that there are no running containers: docker ps Summary docker logs is a very usefull command to troubleshoot containers, and going to be used very often both for Docker and Kubernertes troubleshooting. 1.6 Accessing Containers from the Internet \u00b6 Step 1 Let\u2019s run a simple web application. We will use the existing image training/webapp, which contains a Python Flask application: docker run -d -P training/webapp python app.py ... Status: Downloaded newer image for training/webapp:latest 6e88f42d3d853762edcbfe1fe73fdc5c48865275bc6df759b83b0939d5bd2456 In the command above we specified the main process (python app.py), the -d command line argument, which tells Docker to run the container in the background. The -P command line argument tells Docker to map any required network ports inside our container to our host. This allows us to access the web application in the container. Step 2 Use the docker ps command to list running containers: docker ps CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES 6e88f42d3d85 training/webapp \"python app.py\" 3 minutes ago Up 3 minutes 0.0.0.0:32768->5000/tcp determined_torvalds The PORTS column contains the mapped ports. In our case, Docker has exposed port 5000 (the default Python Flask port) on port 32768 (can be different in your case). Step 3 The docker port command shows the exposed port. We will use the container name (determined_torvalds in the example above, it can be different in your case): docker port <name> 5000 0.0.0.0:32768 Step 4 Let\u2019s check that we can access the web application exposed port: curl http://localhost:<port>/ Result Hello world! Step 5 Let\u2019s stop our web application for now: docker stop <name> Step 6 We want to manually specify the local port to expose (-p argument). Let\u2019s use the standard HTTP port 80. We also want to specify the container name (--name argument): docker run -d -p 80:5000 --name webapp training/webapp python app.py Step 7 Let\u2019s check that the port 80 is exposed: docker ps CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES 249476631f7d training/webapp \"python app.py\" 1 minute ago Up 1 minute 0.0.0.0:80->5000/tcp webapp curl http://localhost/ Result `Hello world!`` Step 8 You can also observe Hello world! webapp from you laptop, for that you need to use you public VM IP that can be gather from VMs list: Your_VM_Public_IP Than paste VM Public IP address in you browser. Result Our web-app can be accessed from Internet! 1.7 Restart a container \u00b6 Step 1 Let\u2019s stop the container with web application: docker stop webapp The main process inside of the container will receive SIGTERM, and after a grace period, SIGKILL. Step 2 You can start the container later using the docker start command: docker start webapp Step 3 Check that the web application works: curl http://localhost/ Hello world! Step 4 You also can restart the running container using the docker restart command. docker restart webapp Step 4 Run docker ps command and check STATUS field: docker ps CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS 6e400179070f training/webapp \"python app.py\" 25 minutes ago Up 3 seconds 1.8 Ensuring Container Uptime \u00b6 Docker considers any containers to exit with a non-zero exit code to have crashed. By default a crashed container will remain stopped. Step 1 Start the container that outputs a message and then exits with code 1 to simulate a crash. docker run -d --name restart-default scrapbook/docker-restart-example docker ps -a | grep restart-default CONTAINER ID IMAGE CREATED STATUS NAMES c854289d2f39 scrapbook/docker-restart-example 5 seconds ago Exited 3 sec ago restart-default $ docker logs restart-default Sun Sep 17 20:34:55 UTC 2017 Booting up... Result Container crushed and exited. However, there are several ways to ensure that you container up and running even if it\u2019s restarts. Step 2 The option --restart=on-failure : allows you to say how many times Docker should try again: docker run -d --name restart-3 --restart=on-failure:3 scrapbook/docker-restart-example docker logs restart-3 Thu Apr 20 14:01:27 UTC 2017 Booting up... Thu Apr 20 14:01:28 UTC 2017 Booting up... Thu Apr 20 14:01:29 UTC 2017 Booting up... Thu Apr 20 14:01:31 UTC 2017 Booting up... Step 3 Finally, Docker can always restart a failed container. In this case, Docker will keep trying until the container is explicitly told to stop. docker run -d --name restart-always --restart=always scrapbook/docker-restart-example docker logs restart-always Step 4 After sometime stop running docker container, as it will be keep failing and starting again: docker stop restart-always 1.9 Inspect a container \u00b6 Step 1 You can use the docker inspect command to see the configuration and status information for the specified container: docker inspect webapp [ { \"Id\": \"249476631f7d...\", \"Created\": \"2016-08-02T23:42:56.932135327Z\", \"Path\": \"python\", \"Args\": [ \"app.py\" ], \"State\": { \"Status\": \"running\", \"Running\": true, \"Paused\": false, \"Restarting\": false, \"OOMKilled\": false, \"Dead\": false, \"Pid\": 16055, \"ExitCode\": 0, \"Error\": \"\", ... Step 2 You can specify a filter (-f command line argument) to show only specific elements. For example: docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' webapp 172.17.0.2 The command returns the IP address of the container. 1.10 Interacting with containers \u00b6 In some cases using docker log is not enough to undertand issues and you want to login inside of running VM. Also sometimes you package you applicaiton and in order to run it you need to login inside of container and execute and leave it running in background. Below provded few ways to interacting with containers that can help to achive descrined use cases. 1.10.1 Detach from Interactive container \u00b6 In Module, 1.4 Run an interactive container we run an Ubuntu container with -it flag and able directly login inside of the container to interact with it, however after we exited contianer using Ctrl-D or exit command container stopped. However you can exit from Interactive mode without stoping a container. Let's demonstrate how this works: Step 1 Start Ubunu container in interactive mode: docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash Step 2 Run watch date command inside running container in order to exit date command every 2 seconds. root@1d688a9f4ed4:/# watch date Step 3 Detach from a container and leave it running using the CTRL-p CTRL-q key sequence. Step 4 Verify that Ubuntu container is still running: docker ps CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS NAMES 1d688a9f4ed4 ubuntu \"/bin/bash\" 1 minutes ago Up 1 minutes admiring_lovelace Result Great you were able to detach from Docker container without stopping it, while it is executing a process in it. What about attaching back to container ? Important CTRL-p CTRL-q sequence key only works if docker contaienr started with -it command! 1.11.2 Attach to a container \u00b6 Now let's get back and attach to our running Ubuntu image. For that docker provides docker attach command. docker attach <container name> Every 2.0s: date Mon Sep 18 00:08:57 2017 Summary docker attach attaches your contairs terminal\u2019s standard input, output, and error (or any combination of the 3) to a running container. This allows you to view its ongoing output or to control it interactively, as though the commands were running directly in your terminal. 1.11.3 Execute a process in a container \u00b6 Step 1 Let verify if webapp container is still running docker ps CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES 249476631f7d training/webapp \"python app.py\" 1 minute ago Up 1 minute 0.0.0.0:80->5000/tcp webapp If not running start it with following command: $ docker run -d -p 80:5000 --name webapp training/webapp python app.py other wise skip to next step . Step 2 Use the docker exec command to execute a command in the running container. For example: docker exec webapp ps aux USER PID %CPU %MEM VSZ RSS TTY STAT START TIME COMMAND root 1 0.2 0.0 52320 17384 ? Ss 00:11 0:00 python app.py root 26 0.0 0.0 15572 2104 ? Rs 00:12 0:00 ps aux The same command with the -it command line argument can be used to run an interactive session in the container: docker exec -it webapp bash root@249476631f7d:/opt/webapp# ps auxw ps auxw USER PID %CPU %MEM VSZ RSS TTY STAT START TIME COMMAND root 1 0.0 0.0 52320 17384 ? Ss 00:11 0:00 python app.py root 32 0.0 0.0 18144 3064 ? Ss 00:14 0:00 bash root 47 0.0 0.0 15572 2076 ? R+ 00:16 0:00 ps auxw Step 2 Use the exit command or press Ctrl-D to exit the interactive bash session: root@249476631f7d:/opt/webapp# exit Summary docker exec is one of the most usefull docker commands used for troubleshooting containers. 1.12 Copy files to/from container \u00b6 The docker cp command allows you to copy files from the container to the local machine or from the local file system to the container. This command works for a running or stopped container. Step 1 Let\u2019s copy the container\u2019s app.py file to the local machine: docker cp webapp:/opt/webapp/app.py . Step 2 Edit the local app.py file. For example, change the line return 'Hello '+provider+'!' to return 'Hello '+provider+'!!!'. Copy the modified file back and restart the container: docker cp app.py webapp:/opt/webapp/ docker restart webapp Step 3 Check that the modified web application works:: curl http://localhost/ Result `Hello world!!!`` 1.12 Remove containers \u00b6 Now let's clean up the environment and at the same time learn how delete containers. Step 1 First list running containers: docker ps CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES 81c4c66baaf9 training/webapp \"python app.py\" 1 minute ago Up 1 minute 0.0.0.0:80->5000/tcp webapp Step 2 Than try to delete running container using docker rm <container_id> docker rm $container_id Error response from daemon: You cannot remove a running container 81c4c66baaf9. Stop the container before attempting removal or force remove. Failure Docker containers needs to be first stopped or deleted using --force flag. docker rm $container_id -f Alternatively, you can run stop and rm in sequence: docker stop 81c4c66baaf9 docker rm 81c4c66baaf9 Summary We've learned a lot of docker commands which are very handy to know both when using Docker and Kubernetes.
